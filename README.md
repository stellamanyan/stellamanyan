## Frutiger Aero theme

This version uses a Vista-inspired frosted glass frame and translucent page body, reflective navigation and section headers, glossy Oxygen icons, and pale reading surfaces over blue light ribbons. A compact grass banner adds the nature imagery associated with Frutiger Aero.

Personalize the same YAML files in `_data/` and Markdown collections as before. The homepage, publication and blog archives, blog articles, Showcase, and the error page share `_layouts/default.html` and the same 1280px maximum frame width.

- Change colors, glass opacity, spacing, and borders through the CSS variables and theme rules in `assets/css/global.css`. `--aero-glass-blur` controls the frosted backdrop; the frame and page body gradients control its tint and reflections.
- Blog reading styles and the contents sidebar are in `assets/css/blog.css`.
- Shared theme helpers are in `_includes/aero/`; navigation entries may optionally specify an `icon` matching a filename in `assets/aero/icons/32/`.
- Small WebP background variants are in `assets/aero/backgrounds/web/`. Original downloads, vector sources, credits, and license information are documented in [the asset kit](assets/aero/README.md).
- The mobile navigation menu and active year links are handled by `assets/js/aero.js`. The header scrolls with the page, and section links use native browser navigation. The theme includes visible keyboard focus, reduced-motion styles, an opaque blur fallback, and print styles.

Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to preview the theme locally. Keep the artwork credits and license/source links when reusing the downloaded assets.
